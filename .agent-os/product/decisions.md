## 2025-07-24: Initial Agent OS Installation

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Adopted Agent OS for the AI-Human Visual Data Interface System project, establishing it as the primary development workflow and documentation system while preserving existing RULES.md conventions.

### Context

The project already had a well-defined structure with RULES.md in .ai-context folder. We needed to integrate Agent OS while preserving these valuable conventions and enhancing them with Agent OS's structured approach.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep only RULES.md**
   - Pros: No change needed, existing system works
   - Cons: Missing structured workflows, no standardized feature planning

2. **Replace RULES.md with Agent OS**
   - Pros: Full Agent OS benefits
   - Cons: Loss of project-specific conventions

3. **Integrate both systems** (Selected)
   - Pros: Best of both worlds, enhanced structure
   - Cons: Potential overlap in some areas

### Rationale

Integration approach was chosen because:
- RULES.md contains valuable project-specific conventions
- Agent OS provides superior workflow management
- Both systems complement each other well
- Minimal disruption to existing development

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Structured feature planning with specs
- Better task tracking and TDD workflow
- Maintains existing file conventions
- Enhanced AI context understanding

**Negative:**
- Two documentation sources to maintain
- Potential for conflicting instructions

## 2025-07-24: No Framework Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Frontend Team

### Decision

Maintain vanilla JavaScript approach without any frontend framework dependencies.

### Context

The project was built with vanilla JS to ensure maximum portability, longevity, and AI-friendliness. This decision needs to be preserved despite modern framework trends.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Adopt React/Vue/Angular**
   - Pros: Modern development experience, component ecosystem
   - Cons: Framework lock-in, complexity, harder for AI to parse

2. **Web Components standard**
   - Pros: Native browser support, encapsulation
   - Cons: Limited browser support, complexity

3. **Vanilla JS with modules** (Selected)
   - Pros: No dependencies, maximum compatibility, AI-friendly
   - Cons: More manual work, no virtual DOM

### Rationale

Vanilla JS was chosen for:
- Zero dependencies means zero security vulnerabilities from deps
- HTML output is predictable and AI-parseable
- Components remain portable across any platform
- No framework version migrations needed

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Permanent compatibility
- Predictable HTML structure
- Easy AI integration
- No build step required

**Negative:**
- Manual DOM manipulation
- No automatic reactivity
- More boilerplate code

## 2025-07-24: Component Registry as Source of Truth

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

The component registry (registry.json) is the single source of truth for all component metadata, dependencies, and usage tracking.

### Context

Need for precise component tracking led to creating a central registry. This must be maintained as the authoritative source for component information.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **File-based scanning**
   - Pros: Automatic discovery
   - Cons: Slower, less metadata

2. **Database tracking**
   - Pros: Advanced queries
   - Cons: Additional infrastructure

3. **JSON registry** (Selected)
   - Pros: Simple, versionable, human-readable
   - Cons: Manual updates needed

### Rationale

JSON registry provides the best balance of simplicity and functionality while remaining accessible to both humans and AI systems.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear component dependencies
- Usage tracking built-in
- Version control friendly
- AI can easily parse

**Negative:**
- Manual registry updates
- Potential for registry drift

## 2025-07-24: Strict File Naming Enforcement

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** All Developers

### Decision

Enforce strict file naming conventions: YYYYMMDD format for views, kebab-case for components, with no exceptions.

### Context

Consistent naming enables automatic tooling and prevents naming conflicts in large projects.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Flexible naming**
   - Pros: Developer freedom
   - Cons: Chaos at scale

2. **Semantic naming only**
   - Pros: Meaningful names
   - Cons: No temporal context

3. **Date-prefixed + semantic** (Selected)
   - Pros: Temporal context, sortable, meaningful
   - Cons: Longer filenames

### Rationale

Date prefixing provides natural chronological ordering while semantic names maintain meaning.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Natural file ordering
- Clear creation timeline
- Conflict prevention
- Automated tooling possible

**Negative:**
- Longer filenames
- Requires discipline

## 2025-07-25: Universal Data Ingestion Architecture

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, AI Agents

### Decision

PROJECT_html will be redesigned as a universal HTML generation framework that accepts any data source (JSON, CSV, Markdown, vector stores) and transforms it into beautiful, interactive HTML5 presentations through a plug-and-play system.

### Context

The original vision focused on component management for developers. However, the real need is for a system that enables AI agents and users to quickly transform any data into professional visualizations without manual HTML coding.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Component library only**
   - Pros: Simpler scope, easier to build
   - Cons: Limited use cases, requires manual integration

2. **Specific data format support**
   - Pros: Optimized for particular use cases
   - Cons: Limited flexibility, multiple tools needed

3. **Universal ingestion system** (Selected)
   - Pros: One tool for all data visualization needs
   - Cons: More complex architecture, longer development

### Rationale

The universal approach was chosen because:
- AI agents need a standard way to create visualizations
- Users have diverse data sources (especially vector stores)
- MCP server integration enables AI-powered generation
- Plug-and-play design maximizes adoption

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Single solution for all data visualization needs
- AI agents can generate documentation at scale
- Vector store integration enables RAG visualizations
- Theme marketplace allows customization

**Negative:**
- More complex data transformation pipeline
- Need to support multiple input formats
- Performance considerations for large datasets
