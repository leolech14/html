## Key Principles from Mermaid Project Analysis

1. **Stability First**: Build robust error handling before features
2. **Test Everything**: Comprehensive test coverage prevents regressions
3. **Memory Conscious**: Track and clean up resources from day one
4. **Performance Aware**: Monitor metrics continuously
5. **Fail Gracefully**: Errors should never crash the application
6. **Code Quality**: Automated linting catches issues early
7. **Clear Architecture**: Maintain separation of concerns

## Deferred Features (Focus on Core Stability)

- Advanced connectors (can add post-1.0)
- Marketplace features (requires infrastructure)
- Multi-language support (adds complexity)
- Enterprise features (not needed for personal use)

## Success Metrics

- **Stability**: Zero crashes in 24-hour usage
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ for critical paths
- **Performance**: Consistent 60fps UI interactions
- **Memory**: Stable usage over extended sessions
- **Code Quality**: Zero linting errors
- **User Experience**: Intuitive without documentation
